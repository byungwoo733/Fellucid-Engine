# Fellucid-Engine
Fellucid Engine™ 펠루시드 엔진 is Individual (2D, 3D) Game Engine(OpenGL / C++), (Editor Based Qt) from Spread Wing Studio 스프레드윙 스튜디오 

* Fellucid means, It came from Pellucid by English. 
SO it mean Clear, Transparent without some Scar
I want to develop transparent Game Engine myself for programming study and rearching
Also, First Spelling "F" of Fellucid changed Spelling by expressing my individual Welling. 

[Engine Master Plan]

Another Challege Roadmap is the Game Engine for support Open Source CPU / GPU 

(Ex) RISC-V, J-Core(Based Hitachi SuperH(SH)), Miaow GPU, Nyuzi Processor etc

I follow under GPL or LGPL from The Qt Company
Even though this engine is much perfect, I`ll open here for growth myself or share my knowlege / Engine Development
